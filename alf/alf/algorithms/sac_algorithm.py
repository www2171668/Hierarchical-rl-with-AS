        Haarnoja et al "Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications", arXiv:1812.05905v2

    There are 3 points different with ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent``:

    1. To reduce computation, here we sample actions only once for calculating
    actor, critic, and alpha loss while ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent``
    samples actions for each loss. This difference has little influence on
    the training performance.

    2. We calculate losses for every sampled steps.
    :math:`(s_t, a_t), (s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})` in sampled transition are used
    to calculate actor, critic and alpha loss while
    ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent`` only uses :math:`(s_t, a_t)` and
    critic loss for :math:`s_{t+1}` is 0. You should handle this carefully,
    it is equivalent to applying a coefficient of 0.5 on the critic loss.

    3. We mask out ``StepType.LAST`` steps when calculating losses but
    ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent`` does not. We believe the correct
    implementation should mask out ``LAST`` steps. And this may make different
    performance on same tasks.

    In addition to continuous actions addressed by the original paper, this
    algorithm also supports discrete actions and a mixture of discrete and
    continuous actions. The networks for computing Q values :math:`Q(s,a)` and
    sampling acitons can be divided into 3 cases according to action types:

    1. Discrete only: a ``QNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. There will
       be no actor network to learn because actions can be directly sampled from
       the Q values: :math:`p(a|s) \propto \exp(\frac{Q(s,a)}{\alpha})`.
    2. Continuous only: a ``CriticNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. An
       ``ActorDistributionNetwork`` for sampling actions will be learned according
       to Q values.

    In addition to the entropy regularization described in the SAC paper, we
    also support KL-Divergence regularization if a prior actor is provided.
    In this case, the training objective is:
        :math:`E_\pi(\sum_t \gamma^t(r_t - \alpha D_{\rm KL}(\pi(\cdot)|s_t)||\pi^0(\cdot)|s_t)))`
    where :math:`pi^0` is the prior actor.

            observation_spec (nested TensorSpec): representing the observations.
            action_spec (nested BoundedTensorSpec): representing the actions; can
                be a mixture of discrete and continuous actions. The number of
                continuous actions can be arbitrary while only one discrete
                action is allowed currently. If it's a mixture, then it must be
                a tuple/list ``(discrete_action_spec, continuous_action_spec)``.
            reward_spec (TensorSpec): a rank-1 or rank-0 tensor spec representing
                the reward(s).
            actor_network_cls (Callable): is used to construct the actor network.
                The constructed actor network will be called
                to sample continuous actions. All of its output specs must be
                continuous. Note that we don't need a discrete actor network
                because a discrete action can simply be sampled from the Q values.
            critic_network_cls (Callable): is used to construct critic network.
                for estimating ``Q(s,a)`` given that the action is continuous.
            q_network (Callable): is used to construct QNetwork for estimating ``Q(s,a)``
                given that the action is discrete. Its output spec must be consistent with
                the discrete action in ``action_spec``.
            reward_weights (None|list[float]): this is only used when the reward is
                multidimensional. In that case, the weighted sum of the q values
                is used for training the actor if reward_weights is not None.
                Otherwise, the sum of the q values is used.
            epsilon_greedy (float): a floating value in [0,1], representing the
                chance of action sampling instead of taking argmax. This can
                help prevent a dead loop in some deterministic environment like
                Breakout. Only used for evaluation. If None, its value is taken
                from ``alf.get_config_value(TrainerConfig.epsilon_greedy)``
            use_entropy_reward (bool): whether to include entropy as reward
            calculate_priority (bool): whether to calculate priority. This is
                only useful if priority replay is enabled.
            num_critic_replicas (int): number of critics to be used. Default is 2.
            env (Environment): The environment to interact with. ``env`` is a
                batched environment, which means that it runs multiple simulations
                simultateously. ``env` only needs to be provided to the root
                algorithm.
            config (TrainerConfig): config for training. It only needs to be
                provided to the algorithm which performs ``train_iter()`` by
                itself.
            critic_loss_ctor (None|OneStepTDLoss|MultiStepLoss): a critic loss
                constructor. If ``None``, a default ``OneStepTDLoss`` will be used.
            initial_log_alpha (float): initial value for variable ``log_alpha``.
            max_log_alpha (float|None): if not None, ``log_alpha`` will be
                capped at this value.
            target_entropy (float|Callable|None): If a floating value, it's the
                target average policy entropy, for updating ``alpha``. If a
                callable function, then it will be called on the action spec to
                calculate a target entropy. If ``None``, a default entropy will
                be calculated.
            prior_actor_ctor (Callable): If provided, it will be called using
                ``prior_actor_ctor(observation_spec, action_spec, debug_summaries=debug_summaries)``
                to constructor a prior actor. The output of the prior actor is
                the distribution of the next action. Two prior actors are implemented:
                ``alf.algorithms.prior_actor.SameActionPriorActor`` and
                ``alf.algorithms.prior_actor.UniformPriorActor``.
            target_kld_per_dim (float): ``alpha`` is dynamically adjusted so that
                the KLD is about ``target_kld_per_dim * dim``.
            target_update_tau (float): Factor for soft update of the target
                networks.
            target_update_period (int): Period for soft update of the target
                networks.
            dqda_clipping (float): when computing the actor loss, clips the
                gradient dqda element-wise between
                ``[-dqda_clipping, dqda_clipping]``. Will not perform clipping if
                ``dqda_clipping == 0``.
            actor_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for actor.
            critic_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for critic.
            alpha_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for alpha.
            debug_summaries (bool): True if debug summaries should be created.
